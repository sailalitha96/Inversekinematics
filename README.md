All algorithms are implemented on the LynX 5 Degree of freedom manipulator arm. 

Inversekinematics - Computes the inverse kinematics of a manipulator arm and provides the set of configuration required to reach the particular position in workspace. 
Trajecotry - Probabilisitc road map was applied on which djikstra and k nearest neighbours were applied to find the optimal path. 

The motion planning on the robot has been implemente don a real time robot : See video Below
